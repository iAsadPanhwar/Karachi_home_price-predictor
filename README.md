#Home Price Prediction




Welcome to the Home Price Prediction project! This project focuses on predicting home prices in specific areas such as Bahria Town, DHA, and Clifton in Karachi.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Keggle. It underwent rigorous data cleaning processes to ensure accuracy and reliability in the predictions. The dataset includes various features such as location, type, no of bedrooms, area in sq yard and no of bathrooms.

Methodology
Data Cleaning: The dataset underwent thorough data cleaning processes to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step was crucial to ensure the quality of the data for training the predictive model.
Algorithm Selection: Grid Search CV (Cross Validation) was employed to determine the best algorithm for the prediction task. This involved evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms with different hyperparameters to identify the most suitable one for our dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Once the optimal algorithm was identified, hyperparameter tuning was performed to fine-tune the model's parameters. This process helps improve the model's performance by optimizing its ability to capture patterns and make accurate predictions.
Model Training: The selected algorithm, along with the tuned hyperparameters, was used to train the predictive model. During the training phase, the model learns from the dataset to make predictions based on the input features.
Predictive Analysis
The trained model is capable of making predictions on home prices in Bahria Town, DHA, and Clifton areas of Karachi. By inputting relevant features such as location, size, and amenities, the model can provide estimates of home prices with a certain degree of accuracy.

Usage
To use the predictive model:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the provided scripts or notebooks to train the model and make predictions.
Input relevant features for the desired area (e.g., location, size, amenities) to obtain predicted home prices.
